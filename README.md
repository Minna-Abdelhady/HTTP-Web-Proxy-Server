# HTTP Web Proxy Server

## Overview

Developed a simple HTTP web proxy server in Python, capable of caching web pages to enhance performance. The server intercepts, forwards, and caches GET requests, efficiently handling various objects including HTML and images. This project demonstrates skills in network protocols, socket programming, and performance optimization through caching.

## Features

- **HTTP Request Interception**
  - Intercepts HTTP GET requests from clients.
  
- **Request Forwarding**
  - Forwards intercepted requests to the destination server.
  
- **Response Caching**
  - Caches web pages and other objects to reduce load times for repeated requests.
  
- **Handles Various Content Types**
  - Supports caching and serving HTML, images, and other web objects.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** `socket`, `threading`
- **Protocols:** HTTP

## File Structure

- `proxy_server.py`: Contains the implementation of the HTTP web proxy server.
